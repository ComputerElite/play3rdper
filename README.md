# Third Person Mod

Allows you to play in third Person

**Features:**
- allows you to offset your head camera position to almost everywhere with the builf in settings.
- also allows you to offset the rotation of your head camera (please note that this is a bit cursed)
- Fixed mode for better recording

**Note:** Third person mod does **not** move your head, it only moves the camera (little but subtle difference). This means you are not immune to walls.
